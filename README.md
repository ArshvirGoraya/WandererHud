Repository Directories:
- Scripts: source code files.
- ModAssets: Assets used by the mod's source code (e.g., material, pictures, etc.).
- .github: any file that will not be used the mod's source code but is still relevant (e.g., mockups).
- Out: Generated .dfmod files (compiled mod).
- Loose File Directories:
	- Textures/images/assets that can replace Daggerfall Unity's assets in the form of loose file should be placed in the same directory that they would be placed if they were used in a loose files mod (e.g,. loose file TOWN00I0.IMG.png placed in the `/Textures/Img` directory).
